   **Example**:
   
   ```
   container.register { ServiceImp() as Service }
   container.register {
     ServiceConsumerImp(
       service1: try container.resolve() as Service
       service2: try container.resolve() as Service

   Instance resolved with the same definition will be reused until topmost `resolve(tag:)` method returns.

   Use this strategy if you want different object in objects graph to share the same instance.
   
   - warning: Make sure this component is thread safe or accessed always from the same thread.
   
   **Example**:
   
   ```
   container.register { ServiceImp() as Service }
   container.register {
     ServiceConsumerImp(
       service1: try container.resolve() as Service
       service2: try container.resolve() as Service

   that was resolved with this definition will be released. When you reset
   the container it will release all singleton instances.
   
   **Example**:
   
   ```
   container.register(.singleton) { ServiceImp() as Service }
   container.register {
     ServiceConsumerImp(
       service1: try container.resolve() as Service
       service2: try container.resolve() as Service
